    <h1>PawAlert</h1>
    <p>Project done for the Web Devepment Course, FII, Year 2</p>
    <p>By Vlad Mocanu and Donia Andrei</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>Purpose and Product Scope</h3>
    <p>
      The app is meant to be used as an board for anyone to report on any animals running
      loose around urban areas. Users can make posts, tag them appropriately, so that they can
      be seen by someone willing to help. People can report on any type of animal, whether they
      are a friendly house pet that ran away and they are trying to find, or a wild beast that
      can pose real danger to those around them.
    </p>
    <h3>Document Conventions</h3>
    <p>
      Within the web application, we use a colour pallete of 6
      colours (#FFFAF0, #EFEFE0 , #55E6CB, #2FCCAF, #FFBB29, #CF9B29), as well as 
      black for the text (#0F0600). The main font used is Montserrat Alternates 
      (or if not available, a generic sans-serif font is used).
    </p>
    <h3>Intended Audience</h3>
    <p>
      The app is intended to be used by those who are trying to find their lost pets,
      people who see stray animals not being taken care of, as well as the more 
      dangerous case when an wild animal is running loose and its location must
      be reported in order for it to be quickly found.
    </p>
    <h3>Reference</h3>
    <p>We used multiple sites as reference, generally being inspired by social media sites
      with a scroll-down post feed.
    </p>
    <h2>Overall Description</h2>
    <p>
